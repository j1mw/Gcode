Play beep sound, use to notify events like the end of printing. If an LCD device is attached to RepRapFirmware, a sound is played via the add-on touch screen control panel. Else the web interface will play a beep sound.

Note: If you intend to play multiple notes in a row, you will need to insert a G4 delay command between them at least equal to the length of the tone.
