### Parameters

* `Dnnn` Extruder number
* `Snnn` Pressure advance amount (in seconds)

## Examples

* ` M572 D0 S0.1 ; set extruder 0 pressure advance to 0.1  ` seconds
* ` M572 D0:1:2 S0.2 ; set extruder 0, 1 and 2 pressure advance to 0.2 seconds (RepRapFirmware 1.20 and  ` later)

This sets the pressure advance coefficient (S parameter) for the specified extruder (D parameter).

Pressure advance causes the extruder drive position to be advanced or retarded during printing moves by an additional amount proportional to the rate of extrusion. At the end of a move when the extrusion rate is decreasing, this may result in the extruder drive moving backwards (i.e. retracting). Therefore, if you enable this feature, you may need to reduce the amount of retraction you use in your slicing program to avoid over-retraction.
