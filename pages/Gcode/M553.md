### Parameters

* `Pnnn` Net mask

## Examples

* ` M553  ` P255.255.255.0

Sets the network mask of the RepRap machine to (in this case) 255.255.255.0. A restart may be required before the new network mask is used. If no 'P' field is specified, this echoes the existing network mask configured.

DuetWifiFirmware versions 1.18 and earlier do not support setting the network mask manually.
