### Parameters

* `S1` Enter simulation mode
* `S0` Leave simulation mode
* `P"filename"` (optional) Simulate printing a file from SD card

## Examples

* ` M37  ` S1
* ` M37  ` P"MyModel.g"

Used to switch between printing mode and simulation mode. Simulation mode allows the electronics to compute an accurate printing time, taking into account the maximum speeds, accelerations etc. that are configured.

M37 S1 enters simulation mode. All G and M codes will not be acted on, but the time they would take to execute will be calculated.

M37 S0 exits simulation mode and prints the total time taken by simulated moves since entering simulation mode..

M37 with no S parameter prints the time taken by the simulation, from the time it was first entered using ` M37 S1, up to the current point (if simulation mode is still active) or the point that the simulation was ended (if simulation mode is no longer  ` active).
