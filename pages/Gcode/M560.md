### Parameters

* As for ` M559 except the default filename is reprap.htm and the default path is /www. If the S parameter is absent then the file data is terminated by a special string as described  ` below.

## Examples

* M560

Was used by the original web interface to upload a file that is the control page. Now deprecated. After sending ` M560 the file (usually an HTML file) should be sent, terminated by the string  ` :

```
<!-- **EoF** -->
```

Clearly that string cannot exist in the body of the file, but can be put on the end to facilitate this process.
