## Usage

* `G60 Snn`

### Parameters

* `Snn` <nn> specifies memory slot # (0-based) to save into (default 0)

Slots 0, 1 and 2 are available. When a print is paused the coordinates are saved to slot 1 automatically, and at the start of a tool change the coordinates are saved to slot 2 automatically. Use G0 or G1 with the R0, R1 or R2 parameter to move the current tool to a saved position.
