Supported in RepRapFirmware 3.x

Height following mode allows the Z position of the tool to be controlled  by a PID controller using feedback from a sensor. See also M594.

Parameters:

* `Snn or Hnn` Sensor number
* `Pnn.n` Proportional factor, in mm per sensor unit
* `Inn.n` Integral factor, in mm per sensor unit per second
* `Dnn.n` Derivative factor, in mm per rate of change of sensor units (change in sensor unit per second)
* `Fnn.n` (optional) Sample and correction frequency (Hz), default 5Hz
* `Znn.n:nn.n` Minimum and maximum permitted Z values

If commanding the motors to increase Z causes the sensor value to increase, then all of P, I and D must be positive. If commanding the motors to increase Z causes the sensor value to decrease, then all of P, I and D must be negative.
