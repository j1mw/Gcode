This command uses a probe to measure the bed height at 4 or more points to determine its tilt and overall flatness. It then enables mesh compensation so that the nozzle will remain parallel to the bed. The printer must be homed with `G28` before using this command.

## Usage

* ` G29  ` S0
* ` G29 S1  ` [P"filename"]
* ` G29  ` S2
* ` G29 S3  ` P"filename"

### Parameters

* `S0` (default if no S parameter) Probe the bed, save the height map in a file on the SD card, and activate bed compensation. The height map is stored in file is ''/sys/heightmap.csv''.
* `S1` Load the height map from file and activate bed compensation. The default filename is as for S0 but a different filename an be specified using the P parameter.
* `S2` Clear height map
* `S3` Save height map (supported in RepRapFirmware 2.04 and later)
* `P"file.csv"` Optional file name for bed height map file to save with `S3` or load with `S1`.
* `Kn` (supported in RRF 3.01-RC5 and later only, default 0) Z probe number

## Examples

G29 S0 ; Probe the bed, save height map to'' heightmap.csv'' and enable compensation

G29 S3 P"usual.csv" ; Save the current height map to file ''usual.csv''

G29 S2 ; clear bed height map (disables bed compensation)

G29 S1 P"usual.csv" ; Load height map file ''usual.csv'' and enable compensation

To define the probe grid, see [M557](M557).html.

You can define a height to taper off the compensation using [M376](M376).html
