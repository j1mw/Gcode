## Examples

* M503

This command asks the firmware to reply with the current print settings stored in sys/config.g. The reply output includes the G-Code commands to produce each setting. For example, the Steps Per Unit values are displayed as an M92 command.

Note that the output may be truncated if it is too long. M503 does `not` include values stored in config-override.g.
