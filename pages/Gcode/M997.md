### Parameters

* `Snnn` Firmware module number(s), default 0
* `Bnnn` CAN address of the board to be updated (RRF_3, Duet 3 only)

## Examples

* ` M997 S0:1 - update firmware modules 0 and  ` 1

## Notes

This command triggers a firmware update if the necessary files are present on the SD card. In RepRapFirmware on the Duet series, module numbers are as follows:

* 0 - main firmware, filename sys/RepRapFirmware.bin (older Duets) or sys/Duet2CombinedFirmware (Duet 2). File sys/iap.bin (Duet) or sys/iap4e.bin (Duet 2) must also be present.
* 1 - web server firmware, filename sys/DuetWiFiServer.bin (Duet 2 WiFi only)
* 2 - web server file system, filename sys/DuetWebControl.bin (needed only when using RepRapFirmware 1.18 series and earlier for Duet 2 WiFi)
* 3 - put the WiFi module into bootloader mode, so that firmware can be uploaded directly via its serial port

On Duet 3 only this command take an optional B (board number) parameter which is the CAN address of the board to be updated, default 0 (i.e. main board).

See [[Installing and Updating Firmware]] for detailed documentation.
