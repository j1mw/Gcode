### Parameters

* `Snnn` (optional) Spindle index, defaults to 0. Duet 2 supports 4 spindles max
* `Pfff:rrr` Logical pin numbers used to drive the spindle motor in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Omit the ":rrr" part if the spindle turns clockwise only.  (Not supported in RRF_3, see notes)
* `I`n Invert (I1) or don't invert (I0, default) the output polarity.   (Not supported in RRF_3, see notes)
* `Rnnn` Spindle RPM that is achieved at full PWM. Used to convert the S parameter in ` M3 and M4 commands to a PWM  ` value.
* `Fnnn` (optional) The PWM frequency to use
* `Tnnn` (optional) Assign spindle to a tool allowing better control in DWC

## Examples

* ` M453 P2 R5000 ; switch to CNC mode using heater 2 (E1 heater) pins to control the spindle  ` motor

Switches to CNC mode. In this mode ` M3/M4/M5 control the pins defined for the milling device. By default, no output is assigned to the spindle motor. Logical pin numbers for the P parameters are as defined for the M42 and M208 commands. If you wish to assign a heater or fan output to control the spindle motor as in the above example, you must first disable the corresponding heater (see M307) or fan (see  ` M106).

`Notes - RepRapFirmware 3`

In RRF_3, the P and I parameters are removed. Use the C parameter to select the spindle control pins instead.

Example - old code (RRF_2.x):

```
M453 P3:4 I1 F100  ; spindle forward/reverse on heater 3&4 pins, PWM frequency 100Hz
```

New code (RRF_3):

```
M453 C"exp.heater3+exp.heater4" F100 ; spindle forward/reverse on heater 3&4 pins, PWM frequency 100Hz
```
