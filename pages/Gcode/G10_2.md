This form of the G10 command is recognised by having the L parameter. Supported on the Duet 2 series and later Duets.

### Parameters

* `Ln` Mode (see below)
* `Pnnn` Tool number if L=1, coordinate system number if L=2 or L=20
* `X,Y,Z,U,V...` Offsets

`Modes`

* L=1: this sets the tool offset,  as if the L parameter was not present
* L=2: this sets the origin of the coordinate system number specified by the P parameter (1 to 9) to the specified X, Y, X... values
* L=20: this is similar to L=2 except that the origin is specified relative to the current position of the tool.

## Examples

Suppose the current machine coordinates are

* X=110
* Y=110
* Z=20

and you want to make this the origin (i.e. X=0, Y=0, Z=0) of the second coordinate system (accessible via G55) then there are two options:

# G10 L2 P2 X110 Y110 Z20
# G10 L20 P2 X0 Y0 Z0

The first example will set offsets to be subtracted from the current machine coordinates.

The second example will set the coordinates of the current position in the specified coordinate system directly.

## Order Dependency

If this command refers to any axes other than X, Y and Z then it must appear later in config.g than the M584 command that creates those additional axes.
