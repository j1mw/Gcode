### Parameters

* `Pnnn` Bed heater index<sub>1</sub>, default 0
* `Hnnn` Heater number
* `Snnn` Active/Target temperature
* `Rnnn` Standby temperature

## Examples

* ` M140  ` S55
* ` M140 S65  ` R40

The first example sets the temperature of the build bed to 55^^o^^C and returns control to the host immediately (''i.e.'' before that temperature has been reached by the bed). There is an optional R field that sets the bed standby temperature, e.g. to 40^^o^^C in the second example

If the absolute negative temperature (-273 or lower) is passed as target temperature, the bed heater to be switched off

M140 S-273

RepRapFirmware also provides an optional 'H' parameter to set the hot bed heater number(s). If no heated bed is present, a negative value may be specified to disable it. ` M140 commands with H parameters would normally be used only in the config.g  ` file.

<sub>1</sub> Only supported in RepRapFirmware 1.20 and later. On the Duet 2 WiFi and Duet 2 Ethernet you can configure up to 4 bed heaters.
