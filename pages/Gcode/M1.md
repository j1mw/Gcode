## Usage ##
```
M1
```

The firmware finishes any moves left in its buffer, then it executes the macro file cancel.g if present, if the axes are homed and if a print is being cancelled. Otherwise it attempts to run sleep.g if present before all motors and heaters are turned off. It can still be sent G and M codes, the first of which will wake it up again. See also M0, M112.

If Marlin is emulated in RepRapFirmware, this does the same as M25 if the code was read from a serial or Telnet connection, else the macro file sleep.g is run before all heaters and drives are turned off.
