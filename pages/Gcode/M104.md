### Parameters

* `Snnn` target temperature
* `Tn` optional tool number

## Examples

* M104 S190
* M104 S220 T1

The first example sets the active and standby temperature of the current tool to 190^^o^^C and return control to the host immediately (''i.e.'' before that temperature has been reached by the extruder).   If no tool is active, it will apply to the lowest non-negative tool number.

The second example sets the active and standby temperatures of tool 1 to 220^^o^^C.  If tool 1 is off, it will be set to standby as well (resulting in tool 1 heating up to the temperature given).

See also M109.

This is deprecated because temperatures should be set using the G10 and T commands.
