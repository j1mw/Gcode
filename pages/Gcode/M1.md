## Examples

* M1

The firmware finishes any moves left in its buffer, then it executes the macro file `cancel.g` if present, if the axes are homed and if a print is being cancelled.  Otherwise it attempts to run `sleep.g` if present before all motors and heaters are turned off. It can still be sent G and M codes, the first of which will wake it up again. See also M0, M112.

If Marlin is emulated in RepRapFirmware, this does the same as [M25](M25.html) if the code was read from a serial or Telnet connection, else the macro file `sleep.g` is run before all heaters and drives are turned off.
