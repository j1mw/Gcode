## Usage ##
```
M582 Tnnn
```

### Parameters ###
 
+ T Trigger number to poll

## Example ##

+ M582 T2 ; check levels of inputs that give rise to trigger #2

Triggers set up by the M581 command are normally activated only when the specified inputs change state. This command provides a way of causing the trigger to be executed if the input is at a certain level. For each of the inputs associated with the trigger, the trigger condition will be checked as if the input had just changed from the opposite state to the current state.

For example, if you use M581 to support an out-of-filament sensor, then M582 allows you to check for out-of-filament just before starting a print.
