## Usage ##
```
M25
```

### Parameters ###
+ none

The machine pauses printing at the current position within the file. To resume printing, use M24. Do not use this code to pause the print in the currently printing G-code file, use M226 instead. M226 is intended for use in the GCode file being printed, for example to pause after a particular layer has completed. So it waits until all the moves in the queue have been completed. M25 is intended for use from a different source of GCodes (like the web interface console, PanelDue or Macro)

Prior to pausing, the macro file pause.g is run. This allows the head to be moved away from the print, filament to be retracted, etc.
