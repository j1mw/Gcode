`Parameters for Duet 2 Ethernet and 06/085`

* `Pnnn` IP address, 0.0.0.0 means acquire an IP address using DHCP
* `Snnn` 0 = disable networking, 1 = enable networking
* `Rnnn` (optional, RepRapFirmware 1.17 and earlier only) HTTP port, default 80

`Parameters for Duet 2 WiFi`

* `P"ssid"` (optional, RepRapFirmware 1.20 and later) SSID of network to connect to. The SSID and password must already have been registered using M587. If this parameter is not present, the Duet 2 WiFi will try to connect to the strongest network that is broadcasting its SSID and whose SSID has been registered using M587.
* `Snnn` 0 = disable networking, 1 = enable networking as a client, 2 = enable networking as an access point , -1 = disable WiFi module

`Example (Duet 2 Ethernet)`

* M552 S1 P192.168.1.14

Sets the IP address of the machine to (in this case) 192.168.1.14. If the S parameter is not present then the enable/disable state of the network interface is not changed.

`Example (Duet 2 WiFi)`

* M552 S1 P"MyNetwork"

M552 with no parameters reports the current network state and IP address.

In firmware 1.18 and later the HTTP port address is set using the M586 command, so the R parameter of this command is no longer supported.

On the Duet 2 WiFi running firmware 1.19 and later, the IP address is set in the M587 command when you configure the access point details.
