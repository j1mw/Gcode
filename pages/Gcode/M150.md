### Parameters

* `Rnnn` Red component, 0-255
* `Unnn` Green component, 0-255
* `Bnnn` Blue component, 0-255
* `Pnnn` Brightness, 0-255 (RepRapFirmware 2.03 and later)
* `Snnn` Number of individual LEDs to set to these colours
* `Fn` Following command action. F0 (default) means this is the last command for the LED strip, so the next ` M150 command starts at the beginning of the strip. F1 means further M150 commands for the remainder of the strip follow this  ` one.
* `Xn` LED type: X0 (default) = DotStar, X1 = NeoPixel. This parameter is remembered from one call to the next, so it only needs to be given once.
* `Ynn` 'Brightness, 0-31 (alternative to P 0-255)
* `Qnnn` Use specified SPI frequency (in Hz) instead of default frequency. This parameter is only processed if X parameter also present. When using NeoPixels, only frequencies in the range 2.4 to 4MHz will work.

## Examples

```

M150 X1 F3000000           ; set LED type to NeoPixel and set SPI frequency to 3MHz
M150 R255 P128 S20 F1      ; set first 20 LEDs to red, half brightness, more commands for the strip follow
M150 U255 B255 P255 S20    ; set next 20 LEDs to cyan, full brightness, finished programming strip

```

This command is only supported on controllers that have an output connector for DotStar or NeoPixel LEDs.

The specified RGB values will be sent to the number of LEDs in the LED  strip as specified by the S parameter, pushing the existing colours along the strip. To set all the LEDs the same colour, make the S parameter equal to or a little longer than the number of LEDs in the strip.
