## ` M581 - RepRapFirmware 2.x and earlier  ` 

### Parameters

* `Tnn` Logical trigger number to associate the endstop input(s) with, from zero up to a firmware-specific maximum (e.g. 9 for RepRapFirmware)
* `X, Y, Z, E` Selects endstop input(s) to monitor
* `P` Reserved, may be used in future to allow general I/O pins to cause triggers
* `S` Whether trigger occurs on a rising edge of that input (S1, default), falling edge (S0), or ignores that input (S-1). By default, all triggers ignore all inputs.
* `C` Condition: whether to trigger at any time (C0, default) or only when printing a file from SD card (C1)

## Examples

* ` M581 E1:2 S1 T2 C1 ; invoke trigger 2 when a rising edge is detected on the E1 or E2 endstop input and a file is being printed from SD  ` card

## Notes

* When ` M581 is executed, if the T parameter is present but the other parameters are omitted, the trigger inputs and edge polarities for that trigger number are reported. Otherwise, the specified inputs and their polarities are added to the conditions that cause that trigger. Using S-1 with no X Y Z or E parameters sets the trigger back to ignoring all  ` inputs.
* Trigger number 0 causes an emergency stop as if ` M112 had been received. Trigger number 1 causes the print to be paused as if M25 had been received. Any trigger number # greater than 1 causes the macro file sys/trigger#.g to be executed. Polling for further trigger conditions is suspended until the trigger macro file has been completed. RepRapFirmware does not wait for all queued moves to be completed before executing the macro, so you may wish to use the M400 command at the start of your macro file. If several triggers are pending, the one with the lowest trigger number takes  ` priority.

## ` M581 - RepRapFirmware 3.0 to 3.01RC1 (but not 3.01RC2 and later)  ` 

### Parameters

* `P` Specify one or more pin names
* `Tnn` Logical trigger number to associate the endstop input(s) with, from zero up to a firmware-specific maximum
* `C` Condition: whether to trigger at any time (C0, default) or only when printing a file from SD card (C1)

## Examples

* ` M581 P"e0stop+e1stop" T2 C1 ; invoke trigger 2 when a rising edge is detected on the E1 or E2 endstop input and a file is being printed from SD  ` card
* ` M581 P"nil" T2 ; don't invoke trigger 2 on any input change any  ` more

## Notes

* Use the P parameter to specify one or more pin names. Use P"nil" to disable that trigger number.
* The pin(s) do not need to be exclusively used by ` M581; for example, it is permitted to specify the name of a pin that has already been declared as used by an endstop switch in a M574  ` command.
* The S parameter used in RRF_2.x  is removed. The command waits for a low-to-high input transition. To wait for a high-to-low transition, invert the pin name using '!'.
* When ` M581 is executed, if the T parameter is present but the other parameters are omitted, the trigger inputs and edge polarities for that trigger number are reported. Otherwise, the specified inputs and their polarities are added to the conditions that cause that trigger.  ` 
* Trigger number 0 causes an emergency stop as if ` M112 had been received. Trigger number 1 causes the print to be paused as if M25 had been received. Any trigger number # greater than 1 causes the macro file sys/trigger#.g to be executed. Polling for further trigger conditions is suspended until the trigger macro file has been completed. RepRapFirmware does not wait for all queued moves to be completed before executing the macro, so you may wish to use the M400 command at the start of your macro file. If several triggers are pending, the one with the lowest trigger number takes  ` priority.

## ` M581 - RepRapFirmware 3.01RC2 and later  ` 

### Parameters

* `P` Specify one or more input pin numbers that you created using ` M950 with the J  ` parameter
* `Tnn` Logical trigger number to associate the input(s) with, from zero up to a firmware-specific maximum
* `S` Whether trigger occurs on an inactive-to-active edge of that input (S1, default), active-to-inactive edge (S0), or ignores that input (S-1). By default, all triggers ignore all inputs.
* `C` Condition: whether to trigger at any time (C0, default) or only when printing a file from SD card (C1)

## Examples

* ` M581 P0:3 S1 T2 C1 ; invoke trigger 2 when an inactive-to-active edge is detected on input 0 or input 3 and a file is being printed from SD  ` card
* ` M581 T2 C-1 ; don't invoke trigger 2 on any input change any  ` more

## Notes

* When ` M581 is executed, if the T parameter is present but the other parameters are omitted, the trigger inputs and edge polarities for that trigger number are reported. Otherwise, the specified inputs and their polarities are added to the conditions that cause that trigger.  ` 
* Trigger number 0 causes an emergency stop as if ` M112 had been received. Trigger number 1 causes the print to be paused as if M25 had been received. Any trigger number # greater than 1 causes the macro file sys/trigger#.g to be executed. Polling for further trigger conditions is suspended until the trigger macro file has been completed. RepRapFirmware does not wait for all queued moves to be completed before executing the macro, so you may wish to use the M400 command at the start of your macro file. If several triggers are pending, the one with the lowest trigger number takes  ` priority.
