## ` M577 - RepRapFirmware 2.x and earlier  ` 

### Parameters

* `Snnn` Desired endstop level
* `Xnnn` Select X axis endstop
* `Ynnn` Select Y axis endstop
* `Znnn` Select Z axis endstop
* `Ennn` Select extruder drive endstop

## Examples

* ` M577 E0  ` S1

Wait for an endstop switch to be pressed. The example above will wait until the first extruder endstop is triggered.

The following trigger types may be used using the 'S' parameter:

0: Endstop not hit

1: Low endstop hit

2: High endstop hit

3: Near endstop (only Z probe)

## ` M577 - RepRapFirmware 3.0 up to 3.01RC1  ` 

### Parameters

* `P"nnn"` Specifies one or more pin names

## Examples

* ` M577  ` P"!xstop+!e0stop"

In RRF_3, use the P parameter to specify one or more pin names. The pin(s) do not need to be exclusively used by ` M577; for example, it is permitted to specify the name of a pin that has already been declared as used by an endstop switch in a M574  ` command.

The command waits for a high input level. To wait for a low input level, invert the pin name by prefixing "!".

Example - old code (RRF_2.x):

```
M577 X E0 S0 ; wait until the X and E0 endstop inputs are both low
```

New code (RRF_3):

```
M577 P"!xstop+!e0stop" ; wait until the X and E0 endstop inputs are both low
```

## ` M577 - RepRapFirmware 3.01RC2 and later  ` 

### Parameters

* `Sn` Desired endstop or input level: 1 = triggered/active (default), 0 =not triggered/inactive
* `X, Y, Z, U, V, W, A, B, C, D` Axis endstop to wait for
* `Pnnn` Input pin number to wait for (see ` M950 with J  ` parameter)

## Examples

* ` M577 X S0  ; wait until X endstop is not  ` triggered
* ` M577 P2 ;  ` wait

Wait for an endstop switch to be triggered or an input to become active.
