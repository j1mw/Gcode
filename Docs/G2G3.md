# G2 & G3: Controlled Arc Move #
Supported by RRF_1.18 and later.

## Usage ##

+ G2 Xnnn Ynnn Znnn Innn Jnnn Ennn Fnnn (Clockwise Arc)
+ G3 Xnnn Ynnn Znnn Innn Jnnn Ennn Fnnn (Counter-Clockwise Arc)

## Parameters ##

+ Xnnn The position to move to on the X axis.
+ Ynnn The position to move to on the Y axis.
+ Znnn The position to move to on the Z axis.
+ Innn The X coordinate of the arc centre relative to the current X coordinate (optional, ignored if R parameter is present).
+ Jnnn The Y coordinate of the arc centre relative to the current Y coordinate (optional, ignored if R parameter is present).
+ Ennn The amount to extrude between the starting point and ending point.
+ Fnnn The feedrate per minute of the move between the starting point and ending point (optional, defaults to the current feed rate).
+ Rnnn The radius of the arc (optional, RRF_2.03 and later)
Either the R parameter must be provided, or at least one of I and J must be provided. To draw a complete circle, define the position of the centre using I and/or J and make X and Y the same as the current X and Y coordinates.

## Examples ##

+ G2 X90.6 Y13.8 I5 J10 E22.4 (Move in a Clockwise arc from the current point to point (X=90.6,Y=13.8), with a center point at (X=current_X+5, Y=current_Y+10), extruding 22.4mm of material between starting and stopping)
+ G3 X90.6 Y13.8 I5 J10 E22.4 (Move in a Counter-Clockwise arc from the current point to point (X=90.6,Y=13.8), with a center point at (X=current_X+5, Y=current_Y+10), extruding 22.4mm of material between starting and stopping)
+ G2 X100 Y50 R200 (draw a clockwise arc with radius 200 from the current position to X=100 Y=50)
