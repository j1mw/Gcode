This provides an interface to identify objects on the print bed and cancel them. Basic usage: Use `M486 Tnn` to tell the firmware how many objects there are, so it can provide an LCD interface. (Otherwise the firmware counts them up in the first layer.) In every layer of your G-code, preface each object's layer slice with `M486 S[index]` to indicate which object is being printed. The index should be zero-based. To cancel the first object, use `M486 P0`; to cancel the 5th object use `M486 P4`; and so on. The "current" object is canceled with `M486 C`.

G-codes associated with the canceled objects are no longer printed. Firmware supports this feature by ignoring ` G0-G3/G5 moves in XYZ while updating F and keeping the E coordinate up-to-date without  ` extruding.

Slicers should number purge towers and other global features with a negative index (or other flag) to distinguish them from regular print objects, since it is important to preserve color changes, purge towers, and brims.

## Usage

* ` M486 T12             ; Total of 12 objects (otherwise the firmware must  ` count)
* ` M486 S3                ; Indicate that the 4th object is starting  ` now
* ` M486 S3 A"cube copy 3" ; Indicate that the 4th object is starting now and name  ` it
* ` M486 S-1              ; Indicate a non-object, purge tower, or other global  ` feature
* ` M486 P10             ; Cancel object with index 10 (the 11th  ` object)
* ` M486 U2               ; Un-cancel object with index 2 (the 3rd  ` object)
* ` M486 C                  ; Cancel the current object (use with  ` care!)

If the GCode file being printed contains object label comments (e.g. using the "Label objects" option in PrusaSlicer) then it is not necessary to use ` M486 S commands to indicate which object is being printed. Objects on the build plate will be numbered from 0 in the order in which their labels first appear in the  ` file.

If you do use ` M486 S commands in the GCode file instead of object label comments, then RepRapFirmware provides an optional A parameter to the M486 S command to allow objects to be named. The name of each object need only be specified  ` once.

For the benefit of Duet Web Control and other user interfaces, the list of objects on the build plate known to RRF may be retrieved from the object model using ` M409, including their names (if available) and approximate  ` locations.

Supported in RRF 3.01-RC5 and later.
