`This command is not enabled unless the SUPPORT_INKJET feature is enabled when the firmware is built.`

### Parameters

* `Pnnn` Inkjet head number
* `Snnn` Bit pattern

## Examples

* ` M578 P3  ` S5

This fires inkjet head 3 (the P field) using the bit pattern specified by the S field. The example shown would fire bits 101. If the P parameter is ommitted inkjet 0 is assumed.

This is a version of the ` M700 command used by [http://reprap.org/wiki/ ` Inkshield].

An alternative way of controlling inkjets would be to use the P parameter on the ` G1 command, in conjunction with the M670  ` command.
