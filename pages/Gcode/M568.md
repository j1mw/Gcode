`Deprecated:` from firmware 1.19 onwards, this command is no longer required or supported. If a ` G1 command for the tool provides just one E value, then the mix ratio defined by M567 will always be  ` used.

### Parameters

* `Pnnn` Tool number
* `Snnn` Whether mix ratios should be activated

## Examples

* ` M568 P2  ` S0

Turn on/off automatic mix ratios for tool 2. If the S parameter is 0 mixing is turned off; if it is non-zero it is turned on.

After turning off command ` G1 instructions must send as many E values as the tool has  ` drives:

G1 X20 E0.2:0.4:0.166:0.3

The off state is the default.
