### Parameters

* `Hnnn` Height (mm) over which to taper off the bed compensation

## Examples

* ` M376  ` H10

This command specifies that bed compensation should be tapered linearly over the specified height, so that full bed compensation is applied at Z=0 and no bed compensation is applied when Z is at or above that height. If H is zero or negative then no tapering is applied, so compensation is performed throughout the entire print.

RepRapFirmware does not adjust the extrusion factor to account for the layer height varying when tapered bed compensation is used. Therefore it is recommended that the taper height be set to at least 20x the maximum error in the height map, so that the maximum amount of the resulting over- or under- extrusion is limited to 5%.
