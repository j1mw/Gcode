`This command must not be used in the config,g file`

### Parameters

* `S"ccc"` Network SSID to remove from the remembered list

The specified SSID will be removed from the remembered list and the associated password cleared out of EEPROM. If the SSID is given as "*" then all remembered networks will be forgotten.

The ` M588 command will fail if the WiFi module has not yet been taken out of reset. So if the WiFi module has not been started, send M552 S0 to put it in idle mode first. M588 does not work from within config.g at  ` startup.
