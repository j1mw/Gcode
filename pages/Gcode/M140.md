The first example sets the temperature of the build bed to 55oC and returns control to the host immediately (i.e. before that temperature has been reached by the bed). There is an optional R field that sets the bed standby temperature, e.g. to 40oC in the second example

If the absolute negative temperature (-273 or lower) is passed as target temperature, the bed heater to be switched off

M140 S-273

RepRapFirmware also provides an optional 'H' parameter to set the hot bed heater number(s). If no heated bed is present, a negative value may be specified to disable it. M140 commands with H parameters would normally be used only in the config.g file.

1 Only supported in RepRapFirmware 1.20 and later. On the Duet 2 WiFi and Duet 2 Ethernet you can configure up to 4 bed heaters.
