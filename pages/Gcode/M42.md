### Parameters

* `Pnnn` Pin number
* `Snnn` Pin value
* `Fnnn` PWM frequency (optional)

## Examples

* M42 P7 S255

M42 switches a general purpose I/O pin. Use M42 Px Sy to set pin x to value y. The S field may be in the range 0..1 or 0..255. The pin reference is an internal firmware reference named "digital pin" which It maps on different connector pins depending the hardware.<sub>1</sub>.

`RepRapFirmware 3 Notes`

In RRF_3, before you can use M42 you must create a GPIO port using M950. Then in the M42 command, the P parameter is the GPIO port number, not the logical pin number. Duet 2 supports up to 10 GPIO ports, numbered 0 to 9. No GPIO ports are allocated by default.

In RRF_3, the F and I parameters are no longer supported in M42. Instead, use the F and I parameters in M950 when you create the GPIO port.

Example - RRF_2 code:

[code]M42 P3 I1 S0.5 F500  ; set Heater 3 pin to 50% PWM at 500Hz[/code]

RRF_3 code:

[code]
M950 P0 C"exp.heater3" Q500  ; allocate GPIO port 0 to heater3 on expansion connector, 500Hz
...
M42 P0 S0.5  ; set 50% PWM on GPIO port 0
[/code]
