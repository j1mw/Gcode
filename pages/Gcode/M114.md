## Examples

* M114

This reports the X, Y, Z (,U, V, W, A, B, C if configured) and E coordinates to the host. The coordinates reported are those at the end of the last completed move.

For example, the machine returns a string such as:

[code]C: X:10.00 Y:20.00 Z:5.00 E:51.00 E0:51.00 E1:0.00[/code]

The first E value (without an extruder number) is the current virtual extruder position, and is included for the benefit of GCode senders that don't understand multiple extruders. The E0, E1 etc. values are for each individual extruder.
