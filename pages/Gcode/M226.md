```

## Parameters ##
+ none

## Example ##

+ M226

Initiates a pause in the same way as if the pause button is pressed. That is, program execution is stopped and the printer waits for user interaction. M226 is intended for use in the GCode file being printed, for example to pause after a particular layer has completed. So it waits until all the moves in the queue have been completed. M25 is intended for use from a different source of GCodes (Like the web interface console, PanelDue or a Macro) so if you need to pause from those use M25 instead.
