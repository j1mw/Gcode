### Parameters

* `S0` Default value. Transformation matrix is updated in RAM but is not stored. Z bed height not calculated.
* `S1` Transformation matrix is updated in RAM but is not stored. Printer immediately moves to Z maximum position (Z max endstop required!), and calculates new Z maximum height. You must first issue G28 to home to Z maximum position before issuing G32 Snnn for this to work correctly, or the printer height will be invalid.
* `S2` Same as S1, except transformation matrix and Z max heights are also stored.
* `S3` Transformation matrix is stored. Z bed height not calculated.

## Examples

## Usage

* G32
* G32 S2

This command is implemented as a more sophisticated form of bed leveling which uses a transformation matrix or motorized correction.

It probes the bed at 3 or more pre-defined points (see [M557](M557.html)) and updates transformation matrix for bed levelling compensation.

The firmware executes macro file `bed.g` if present instead of using the M557 coordinates.
