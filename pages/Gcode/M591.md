This configures filament sensing for the specified extruder. The sensor may be a simple filament presence detector, or a device that measures movement of filament, or both. The action on a filament error is to pause the print and advise you that there has been a filament error. Note that filament monitoring in RRF is only active when printing from SD card.

===== M591 - RepRapFirmware 3 =====

### Parameters

* `Dnn` Extruder drive number (0, 1, 2...),
* `Pnn` Type of sensor: 
** 0=none
** 1=simple sensor (high signal when filament present)
** 2=simple sensor (low signal when filament present)
** 3=Duet3D rotating magnet sensor
** 4=Duet3D rotating magnet sensor with microswitch
** 5 = Duet3D laser sensor
** 6 = Duet3D laser sensor with microswitch
** 7 = pulse-generating sensor
* `C"name"` Pin name the filament sensor is connected to (RRF_3 only)
* `Sn` 0 = disable filament monitoring (default), 1 = enable filament monitoring when printing from SD card. Supported for all filament sensor types in firmwares 1.21.1 and in 2.0 and later. In firmware 1.21 this parameter is not supported for sensor types 1 and 2. Filament monitors accumulate calibration data (where applicable) even when filament monitoring is disabled.

`Additional parameters for Duet3D laser filament monitor`

* `Raa:bb` Allow the filament movement reported by the sensor to be between aa% and bb% of the commanded values; if it is outside these values and filament monitoring is enabled, the print will be paused
* `Enn` minimum extrusion length before a commanded/measured comparison is done, default 3mm
* `An` (firmware 2.03 and later) 1 = check All extruder motion, 0 (default) = only check extruder motion of printing moves (moves with both movement and forward extrusion)

`Additional parameters for Duet3D rotating magnet filament monitor`

* `Lnn` Filament movement per complete rotation of the sense wheel, in mm
* `R, E, A` As for Duet3D laser filament monitor

`Additional parameters for a pulse generating filament monitor`

* `Lnn` Filament movement per pulse in mm
* `R, E` As for Duet3D laser filament monitor

## Examples

[code]M591 P3 C"e0_stop" S1  ; filament monitor connected to E0_stop[/code]

===== M591 - RepRapFirmware 1.21 to 2.x =====

### Parameters

As RRF_3, except 'C' parameter is the endstop number.

* `Cnn` Which input the filament sensor is connected to. On Duet electronics:  0=X endstop input, 1=Y endstop input, 2=Z endstop input, 3=E0 endstop input etc. If you have a Duex 2 or Duex 5 in your system, note that C5 thru C9 (the endstop inputs on the DueX) cannot be used for filament monitors, but C10 and C11 (the endstop inputs on the CONN_LCD connector) can.

## Examples

[code]M591 D0 P3 C3 S1 R70:130 L24.8 E3.0   ; Duet3D rotating magnet sensor for extruder drive 0 is connected to E0 endstop input, enabled, sensitivity 24.8mm.rev, 70% to 130% tolerance, 3mm detection length[/code]

[code]M591 D0    ; display filament sensor parameters for extruder drive 0[/code]

===== M591 - RepRapFirmware 1.20 and earlier =====

### Parameters

* `Dnn` Extruder drive number (0, 1, 2...),
* `Pnn` Type of sensor, where: 
** 0=none, 
** 1=simple sensor (high signal when filament present)
** 2=simple sensor (low signal when filament present)
** 3=Duet3D rotating magnet sensor
** 4=Duet3D rotating magnet sensor with microswitch
* `Cn` Which input the filament sensor is connected to. On Duet electronics: 0=X endstop input, 1=Y endstop input, 2=Z endstop input, 3=E0 endstop input etc.

`Additional parameters for Duet3D rotating magnet filament monitor`

* `Snn` Sensitivity, in mm of filament movement per complete rotation of the sense wheel.  
* `Rnn` Tolerance as a percentage of the commanded extrusion amount. A negative value puts the firmware in calibration mode.
* `Enn` minimum extrusion length before a commanded/measured comparison is done, default 3mm

## Examples

[code]M591 D0 P5 C3  R70:140 E3.0 S1   ; Duet3D rotating magnet sensor for extruder drive 0 is connected to E0 endstop input, sensitivity 1.05, tolerance 70% to 140%, 3mm detection length[/code]

[code]M591 D1 ; display filament sensor parameters for extruder drive 1[/code]
