`Parameters for Duet 2 Ethernet and 06/085`

* `Pnnn` IP address, 0.0.0.0 means acquire an IP address using DHCP
* `Snnn` 0 = disable networking, 1 = enable networking
* `Rnnn` (optional, RepRapFirmware 1.17 and earlier only) HTTP port, default 80

`Parameters for Duet 2 WiFi`

* `P"ssid"` (optional, RepRapFirmware 1.20 and later) SSID of network to connect to. The SSID and password must already have been registered using ` M587. If this parameter is not present, the Duet 2 WiFi will try to connect to the strongest network that is broadcasting its SSID and whose SSID has been registered using  ` M587.
* `Snnn` 0 = disable networking, 1 = enable networking as a client, 2 = enable networking as an access point , -1 = disable WiFi module

`Example (Duet 2 Ethernet)`

* ` M552 S1  ` P192.168.1.14

Sets the IP address of the machine to (in this case) 192.168.1.14. If the S parameter is not present then the enable/disable state of the network interface is not changed.

`Example (Duet 2 WiFi)`

* ` M552 S1  ` P"MyNetwork"

M552 with no parameters reports the current network state and IP address.

In firmware 1.18 and later the HTTP port address is set using the ` M586 command, so the R parameter of this command is no longer  ` supported.

On the Duet 2 WiFi running firmware 1.19 and later, the IP address is set in the ` M587 command when you configure the access point  ` details.
