### Parameters

* `X,Y,Z` Axis to probe on
* `Fnnnn` Probing feedrate
* `Rnnn` Distance to move away from the lower endstop before the next probing move starts

`Additional Parameter in RepRapFirmware 3 and later`

* `Pnnn` Use probe with the given number instead of endstop

## Examples

* ` M675 X R2  ` F1200

This code is intended to find the center of a cavity that can be measured using the configured axis endstop. If using a Z probe for this purpose, make sure the endstop type for the corresponding axis is updated before this code is run. Once this code starts, RepRapFirmware will move to the lower end looking for an endstop to be triggered. Once it is triggered, the lower position is saved and the axis maximum is probed. As soon as both triggers have been hit, the center point is calculated and the machine moves to the calculated point.
