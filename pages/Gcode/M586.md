### Parameters

* `Pnn` Protocol: 0 = HTTP or HTTPS, 1 = FTP or SFTP, 2 = Telnet or SSH (which of the two choices depends on the T parameter)
* `Snn` 0 = disable this protocol, 1 = enable this protocol
* `Rnn` TCP port number to use for the specified protocol. Ignored unless S = 1. If this parameter is not provided then the default port for that protocol and TLS setting is used.
* `Tnn` 0 = don't use TLS, 1 = use TLS. Ignored unless S = 1. If this parameter is not provided, then TLS will be used if the firmware supports it and a security certificate has been configured. If ` T1 is given but the firmware does not support TLS or no certificate is available, then the protocol will not be enabled and an error message will be returned. `Note: `TLS has not yet been implemented in RepRapFirmware, therefore T1 will not  ` work.

M586 with no S parameter reports the current support for the available protocols.

RepRapFirmware 1.18 and later enable only HTTP (or HTTPS if supported) protocol by default. If you wish to enable FTP and/or Telnet, enable them using this command once or twice in config.g.
