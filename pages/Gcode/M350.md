## Usage ##
```
M350 Xnn Ynn Znn Enn Inn
```

## Parameters ##

Not all parameters need to be used, but at least ''one'' should be used. As with other commands, RepRapFirmware reports the current settings if no parameters are used.
+ Xnn Set stepping mode for the X axis
+ Ynn Set stepping mode for the Y axis
+ Znn Set stepping mode for the Z axis
+ Enn Set stepping mode for Extruder 0 (use Enn:nn:nn etc. for multiple extruders)
+ Inn Enable (nn=1) or disable (nn=0) microstep interpolation mode for the specified drivers, if they support it. The Duet 2 WiFi/Ethernet support interpolation (to x256 microstepping) only when configured for x16 microstepping. The Duet 2 Maestro supports interpolation at all microstep settings.

## Modes (nn) ##

+ 1 = full step
+ 2 = half step
+ 4 = quarter step
+ 8 = 1/8 step
+ 16 = 1/16 step
+ 32 = 1/32 step
+ 64 = 1/64 step
+ 128 = 1/128 step
+ 256 = 1/256 step


## Order dependency ##

This command must be later in config.g than any M584 command.

## Examples ##

+ M350 Z1 ;set the Z-axis' driver to use full steps
+ M350 E4:4:4 ;set extruders 0-2 to use quarter steps)

When M350 is processed, the steps/mm will be adjusted automatically to allow for any changes in microstepping. Therefore you can either:

a) Set Steps/mm correctly for the default 1/16 microstepping, then set the microstepping to the desired amount using M350:

```
M92 X80 Y80 Z400 ; set axis steps/mm
M92 E420:430 ; set extruder 0 and 1 steps/mm
M350 X128 Y128 Z128 E128:128 ; set microstepping
```

or

b) Set the microstepping using M350 and then set the correct steps/mm for that microstepping amount:

```
M350 X128 Y128 Z128 E128:128 ; set microstepping
M92 X640 Y640 Z3200 ; set axis steps/mm @128 microstepping
M92 E3360:3440 ; set extruder 0 and 1 steps/mm
```

Assuming that in the first example the microstepping was initially at the default x16, both the above examples result in the same steps/mm settings.

## Notes ##

RepRapFirmware does not support individual motor settings where an axis has multiple motors connected to different stepper drivers. The first parameter specified will be used for all motors on the axis. You should use identical motors on any axis that has more than one motor to avoid unexpected behaviour.

Example: If you have two motors on your Z axis, physically connected to Z and E0 stepper drivers, configured with M584 Z2:3, set M350 Z16, not M350 Z16,16

Microstep interpolation is available on the TMC2660 drivers used on the Duet 2 WiFi and Duet 2 Ethernet, but only when microstepping is set to 16. In other configurations, specifying I1 has no effect. Microstepping interpolation is available on the TMC2224 drivers used on the Duet 2 Maestro at all microstepping settings,
