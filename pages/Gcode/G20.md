## Examples

* G20

Units from this command onwards are in inches. Note that this is only intended to affect G0, G1 and other commands commonly found in GCode files that represent objects to print. Specifically G20 only affects: G0 to G3, G10 and G92.

So you should use metric values in config.g when configuring the printer and then change to inches with G20 at the end of it if the Gcodes you want to send to move the machine are expressed in inches.
