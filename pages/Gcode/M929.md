### Parameters

* `P"filename"` The name of the file to log to. Only used if the S1 parameter is present. A default filename will be used if this parameter is missing.
* `Sn` S1 = start logging, S0 = stop logging

## Examples

* ` M929 P"eventlog.txt" S1 ; start logging to file  ` eventlog.txt
* ` M929 S0 ; stop  ` logging

When event logging is enabled, important events such as power up, start/finish printing and (if possible) power down will be logged to the SD card. Each log entry is a single line of text, starting with the date and time if available, or the elapsed time since power up if not. If the log file already exists, new log entries will be appended to the existing file.

`Caution`: do not rename or delete the current log file while logging is enabled!
