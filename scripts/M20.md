### Parameters

* ''This command can be used without any additional parameters.''
* `Snnn` Output style: 0 = text (default), 2 = JSON
* `P"path"` Folder to list, defaults to the standard folder for GCode files (0:/gcodes in RepRapFirmware)
* `Rnnn` Number of files to skip, default 0

## Examples

* ` M20   ; lists all files in the root folder of the internal SD  ` card
* ` M20 S2 P"/gcodes/subdir"   ; lists all files in the gcodes/subdir folder of the internal SD card, using JSON  ` format
* ` M20 P"1:/"   ; lists all files on the secondary (PanelDue) SD card's  ` root

If Marlin compatibility is enabled, a file list response is encapsulated:

```

Begin file list:
 Traffic cone.g
 frog.gcode
 calibration piece.g
 End file list
 ok

```

If RepRapFirmware emulates no firmware compatibility, a typical response looks like:

```

GCode files:
 "Traffic cone.g","frog.gcode","calibration piece.g"

```

RepRapFirmware always returns long filenames in the case in which they are stored.

If the S2 parameter is used then the file list is returned in JSON format as a single array called "files" with each name that corresponds to a subdirectory preceded by an asterisk, and the directory is returned in variable "dir". Example:

```

M20 S2 P"/gcodes"
 {"dir":"/gcodes","first":0,"next":0,"files":["4-piece-1-2-3-4.gcode","Hinged_Box.gcode","Hollow_Dodecahedron_190.gcode","*Calibration pieces"]}

```

Returned value "first" is the number of files that were skipped (as specified in the R parameter), and "next" is the number to skip next time to retrieve the next block of filenames. If "next" is zero then there are no more filenames.
