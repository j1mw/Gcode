## Usage ##

| `G32 Sn` | 

### Parameters ###

+ `S0` Default value. Transformation matrix is updated in RAM but is not stored. Z bed height not calculated.
+ `S1` Transformation matrix is updated in RAM but is not stored. Printer immediately moves to Z maximum position (Z max endstop required!), and calculates new Z maximum height. You must first issue G28 to home to Z maximum position before issuing G32 Snnn for this to work correctly, or the printer height will be invalid.
+ `S2` Same as S1, except transformation matrix and Z max heights are also stored.
+ `S3` Transformation matrix is stored. Z bed height not calculated.

## Examples ##


+ `G32`
+ `G32 S2`

This command is implemented as a more sophisticated form of bed leveling which uses a transformation matrix or motorized correction.

It probes the bed at 3 or more pre-defined points (see M557) and updates transformation matrix for bed levelling compensation.

The firmware executes macro file bed.g if present instead of using the M557 coordinates.
