## Usage ##

| `M303 Hnnn Pnnn Snnn` | 

### Parameters ###

+ `Hnnn` heater number
+ `Pnnn` PWM to use, 0 to 1 (you should normally use 1 i.e. full power), default 1
+ `Snnn` target temperature

## Examples ##

+ `M303 H1 P0.4 S240` Tune heater 1 using 40% PWM, target temperature 240C

PID Tuning refers to a control algorithm used to tune heating behaviour for hot ends and heated beds. This command computes the process model parameters (see M307), which are in turn used to calculate the PID constants. Note that the tuning algorithm will overshoot the target temperature; the amount of overshoot depends on how powerful the heater is. See Wiki:Tuning Temperature Control.

Tuning is performed asynchronously. Run M303 with no parameters to see the current tuning state or the last tuning result.
