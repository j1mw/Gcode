The firmware finishes any moves left in its buffer, then it executes the macro file cancel.g if present, if the axes are homed and if a print is being cancelled. Otherwise stop.g is run before all motors are put into idle mode. If no H1 parameter is present, the heaters are turned off too. See also M1, M112.
