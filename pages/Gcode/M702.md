## Example ##

+ M702

In contrast to M701 this code is intended to unload the previously loaded filament from the selected tool. RepRapFirmware will do the following when called:

1) Run the macro file "unload.g" in the subdirectory of the given material (e.g. /filaments/PLA/unload.g)

2) Change the filament name of the current tool, so it can be reported back to Duet Web Control
