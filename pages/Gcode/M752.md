### Parameters

* Snnn: Length/degrees of the scan
* Rnnn: Resolution (new in RRF 2.0) [optional, defaults to 100]

## Examples

M752 S300 Pmyscan

Instruct the attached 3D scanner to initiate a new 3D scan and to upload it to the board's SD card (i.e. in the "scans" directory). Before the SCAN command is sent to the scanner, the macro file "scan_pre.g" is executed and when the scan has finished, the macro file "scan_post.g" is run. Be aware that both files must exist to avoid error messages.
