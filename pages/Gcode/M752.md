## Usage ##

| `M752 Snnn Rnnn Nnnn Pnnn` | 

### Parameters ###

+ `Snnn`: Length/degrees of the scan
+ `Rnnn`: Resolution (new in RRF 2.0) [optional, defaults to 100]
+ `Nnnn`: Scanner mode (new in RRF 2.0) [optional, 0=Linear (default), 1=Rotary]
+ `Pnnn`: Filename for the scan

## Example ##

+ `M752 S300 Pmyscan`

Instruct the attached 3D scanner to initiate a new 3D scan and to upload it to the board's SD card (i.e. in the "scans" directory). Before the SCAN command is sent to the scanner, the macro file "scan_pre.g" is executed and when the scan has finished, the macro file "scan_post.g" is run. Be aware that both files must exist to avoid error messages.
