## Examples

* M25

The machine pauses printing at the current position within the file. To resume printing, use [M24](M24).html. Do not use this code to pause the print in the currently printing G-code file, use [M226](M226).html instead. ` M226 is intended for use in the GCode file being printed, for example to pause after a particular layer has completed. So it waits until all the moves in the queue have been completed. M25 is intended for use from a different source of GCodes (like the web interface console, PanelDue or  ` Macro)

Prior to pausing, the macro file `pause.g` is run. This allows the head to be moved away from the print, filament to be retracted, etc.
