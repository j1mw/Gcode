## Usage ##
```
M578 Pnnn Snnn 
```

## Parameters ##

+ Pnnn Inkjet head number
+ Snnn Bit pattern

## Example ##

+ M578 P3 S5

This fires inkjet head 3 (the P field) using the bit pattern specified by the S field. The example shown would fire bits 101. If the P parameter is ommitted inkjet 0 is assumed.

This is a version of the M700 command used by http://reprap.org/wiki/Inkshield.

An alternative way of controlling inkjets would be to use the P parameter on the G1 command, in conjunction with the M670 command.
