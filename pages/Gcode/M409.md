## Usage ##

| `M409 K"key" F"flags"` | 

### Parameters ###

+ `K"key"` Key string, default empty
+ `F"flags"` Flags string, default empty

## Examples ##

+ `M409 K"move.axes" F"f"` Report all frequently-changing properties of all axes
+ `M409 K"move.axes[0] F"v,n,d4"` Report all properties of the first axis, including values not normally reported, to a maximum depth of 4
+ `M409 K"move.axes[].homed"` For all axes, report whether it is homed
+ `M409 K"#move.axes"` Report the number of axes
+ `M409 F"v"` Report the whole object model to the default depth

The key string is just the path to the object model variables wanted, with the following extensions:

+ An element that is an array may be followed by either [number] to select just one element, or by [] to select all elements and report the results as an array
The path may be preceded by # in which case the path must refer to an array and just the number of array elements is returned
+ An empty key string selects the entire object model. Note, the entire object model may be very large. RepRapFirmware 3.0beta2 and later set a default maximum depth of 1 if the key string is empty or not present, to avoid generating a response that may be too long to send.

The flags string may include one or more of the following letters:

+ f: return only those values in the object model that typically change Frequently during a job
+ v: Verbose: include values that are rarely needed and not normally returned
+ n: include fields with null values
+ d: limit the depth of the reported tree to the specified number following the letter d. Objects at the maximum depth will be returned as {}.

The flags string may optionally use spaces or commas to separate the individual flags

The response is a JSON object of the following form:

```
{"key":"key","flag'":"flags","result":object-value}
```

If the key string is malformed or refers to a property that does not exist in the object model, the result field is null.
