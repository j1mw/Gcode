## Usage ##

| `M108` | 


### Parameters ###
+ none

Use this command with caution! If cold extrusion prevention is enabled (see M302) and the temperature is too low, this will start "printing" without extrusion. If cold extrusion prevention is disabled and the hot-end temperature is too low, the extruder may jam.
