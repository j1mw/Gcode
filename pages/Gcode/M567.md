### Parameters

* `Pnnn` Tool number
* `Ennn` Mix ratios

## Examples

* ` M567 P2  ` E0.1:0.2:0.1:0.6

This example sets the mix ratio for tool 2 (the P value). When mixing is then turned on (see ` M568), only single E values need to be sent on a G1 command (any extra E values will be ignored, but are not  ` illegal):

G1 X20 E1.3

This will move to X=20 extruding a total length of filament of 1.3mm. The first drive of tool 2 will extrude 0.1*1.3mm, the second 0.2*1.3mm and so on. The ratios don't have to add up to 1.0 - the calculation done is as just described. But it is normally sensible if they do, otherwise under or over extrusion would occur.

`WARNING`: Currently the firmware will allow to set a mixing ratio where every extruder will drive at 100% - in case of a setup where several extruders feed the same hotend (like Diamond Hotends) this can lead to dangerously high pressures that could damage the printer.
