### Parameters

* ''This command can be used without any additional parameters.''
* `Pnnn` report specific information (See Notes)
* `Bnnn` Board number (RRF_3/Duet 3 only, see Notes)
* `"DSF"` Immediate DSF diagnostics (RRF_3/Duet3 only with attached SBC)

## Examples

* M122

Sending an ` M122 causes the RepRap to transmit diagnostic  ` information.

## Notes

The 'P' parameter is used to report specific information. The details vary between releases. As at RepRapFirmware version 2.03 they are:

* P1 print summary test report (additional parameters: Taa:bb = min/max accepted MCU temperature reading, Vaa:bb = min/max VIN voltage reading, Waa:bb = min/max 12V regulator voltage reading if applicable)
* P100 print a summary of recent moves (only if move logging is enabled in the firmware build)
* P101 print the status of an attached DueX expansion board
* P102 print how long it takes to evaluate the square root of a 62-bit unsigned integer
* P103 print how long it takes to evaluate sine and cosine
* P104 print how long it takes to write a file to the SD card (specify the file size in Mbytes in the S parameter, default 10)
* P105 print the sizes of various objects used by RepRapFirmware

Note: do not use ` M122 with a P parameter of 1000 or greater.  There are a few values that deliberately cause the firmware to crash, which are used to test the error reporting facilities. As at firmware 2.03 these  ` are:

* P1001 cause a watchdog reset
* P1002 test what happens when a module gets stuck in a spin loop
* P1003 test what happens when we write a blocking message to USB
* P1004 test integer division by zero
* P1005 test the response to an unaligned memory access
* P1006 test the response to accessing an invalid region of memory

The 'B' parameter is used in RepRapFirmware 3 on Duet 3 only, to report diagnostic information from connected boards. The B (board number) parameter is the CAN address of the board to be queried, default 0 (i.e. main board). Example:

```
