### Parameters

* Pnnn Whether to turn on (> 0) or off (<= 0) the alignment feature

## Examples

M755 P1

M755 P0

Sends the ALIGN ON/OFF command the attached 3D scanner. Some devices turn on a laser when this command is received. If the 'P' parameter is missing, equal to, or less than 0, the alignment feature is turned off. Depending on whether the alignment is turned on or off, either align_on.g or align_off.g is executed before the ALIGN command is sent to the scanner.
