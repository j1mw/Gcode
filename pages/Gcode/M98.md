### Parameters

* `P"nnn"` Macro filename<sub>1</sub>

## Examples

* M98 P"mymacro.g"

Runs the macro in the file mymacro.g. Macro calls can be nested (ie a macro can call another macro).

The filename to include a path to a subdirectory. For relative paths, the default folder is /sys, but some implementations may check the /macros directory too. Absolute file paths are also supported starting with "0" for the internal SD card or "1" for the external SD card if fitted.

## Notes

<sub>1</sub> In RRF_2.x and earlier, string can be enclosed in quotes if required, see [[GCode#Section_Quoted_strings|Quoted Strings]] for details. In RRF_3, quotation marks around the filename are mandatory.
