## Usage ##

| `M562 Pnnn` |

### Parameters ###

+ `Pnnn` Heater number

## Example ##

+ `M562 P2`

Reset a temperature fault on heater/sensor 2. If the heater has switched off and locked because it has detected a fault, this will reset the fault condition and allow you to use the heater again. Obviously to be used with caution. If the fault persists it will lock out again after you have issued this command. P0 is the bed; P1 the first extruder, and so on.

In firmware 1.20 and later, M562 with no parameters will clear a heater fault on all heaters
