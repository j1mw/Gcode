Parameters

* `Hnnn` heater number
* `Pnnn` PWM to use, 0 to 1 (you should normally use 1 i.e. full power), default 1
* `Snnn` target temperature

## Examples

* ` M303 H1 P0.4 S240 ; tune heater 1 using 40% PWM, target temperature  ` 240C

PID Tuning refers to a control algorithm used to tune heating behaviour for hot ends and heated beds. This command computes the process model parameters (see [M307](M307).html), which are in turn used to calculate the PID constants. Note that the tuning algorithm will overshoot the target temperature; the amount of overshoot depends on how powerful the heater is.  See [[Tuning the heater temperature control|Wiki:Tuning Temperature Control]].

Tuning is performed asynchronously. Run ` M303 with no parameters to see the current tuning state or the last tuning  ` result.
