## Usage ##
```
M917 XYZE 
```

## Parameters ##

+ X,Y,Z,E Percentage of normal current to use when the motor is standing still or moving slowly, default 100

## Order dependency ##

If this command refers to any axes other than X, Y and Z then it must appear later in config.g than the M584 command that creates those additional axes.

## Example ##

+ M917 X70 Y70 Z80 E70:70

Some motor drivers allow higher motor currents to be used while the motor is moving. This command sets the percentage of the current set by M906 that is to be used when the motor is stationary but not idle, or moving very slowly.

Standstill current reduction is not the same as idle current reduction. The standstill current must be high enough to produce accurate motion at low speeds. The idle current needs only to be high enough to hold the motor position well enough so that when the current is restored to normal, the position is the same as it was before the current was reduced to idle.
