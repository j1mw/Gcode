The details are returned to the host computer as key:value pairs separated by spaces and terminated with a linefeed.:

```

M115
FIRMWARE_NAME: RepRapFirmware for Duet 2 WiFi/Ethernet FIRMWARE_VERSION: 2.04RC1 ELECTRONICS: Duet WiFi 1.0 or 1.01 FIRMWARE_DATE: 2019-07-14b1

```

See the ` M408 command for a more comprehensive report on machine  ` capabilities.

## Notes

The 'P' parameter is used tell the firmware about the hardware on which it is running, if RRF can't identify it. Should only be used in config.g, if you're having problems. If the P parameter is present then the integer argument specifies the hardware being used. The following are supported on first-generation Duets:

* ` M115 P0 - Automatic board type selection if supported, or default if  ` not
* ` M115 P1 - Duet  ` 0.6
* ` M115 P2 - Duet  ` 0.7
* ` M115 P3 - Duet  ` 0.85

The 'B' parameter is used on Duet 3 only, using RRF_3. ` M115 can take an optional B (board number) parameter which is the CAN address of the board to be queried, default 0 (i.e. main board).  ` Example:

```

M115 B1
Board EXP3HC firmware 3.0beta1 2019-10-28b1

```
