''RepRapFirmware 2.02 and later''

M851 Znn is implemented for backwards compatibility with other firmware. It sets the Z probe trigger in the same way as [[Gcode#Section_G31_Set_or_Report_Current_Probe_status|G31 Z-nn]] ''(note the sign reversal)''. It also flags the Z-probe ` G31 parameters as to be saved in config-override.g if the M500 command is  ` used.

[G31](G31).html should be used in preference to M581.
