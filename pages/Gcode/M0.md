### Parameters

* ''This command can be used without any additional parameters.''
* `Hnnn` Keep heaters on

## Examples

* M0

The firmware finishes any moves left in its buffer, then it executes the macro file `cancel.g` if present, if the axes are homed and if a print is being cancelled. Otherwise `stop.g` is run before all motors are put into idle mode. If no H1 parameter is present, the heaters are turned off too. See also ` M1,  ` M112.
