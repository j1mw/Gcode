## Usage ##

| `M104 Snnn Tn` | 


### Parameters ###
+ `Snnn` target temperature
+ `Tn` optional tool number

## Example ##

+ `M104 S190`
+ `M104 S220 T1`

The first example sets the active and standby temperature of the current tool to 190oC and return control to the host immediately (i.e. before that temperature has been reached by the extruder). If no tool is active, it will apply to the lowest non-negative tool number.

The second example sets the active and standby temperatures of tool 1 to 220oC. If tool 1 is off, it will be set to standby as well (resulting in tool 1 heating up to the temperature given).

See also M109.

This is deprecated because temperatures should be set using the G10 and T commands.
