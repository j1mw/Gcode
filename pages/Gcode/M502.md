## Examples

* M502

This sets all machine parameters to the values defined in config.g, ignoring the config-override.g file so that any changes that were saved by ` M500 are not applied. It does this by running config.g but ignoring any M501 commands that it  ` contains.

M502 does not clear or reset the config-override.g file; so next time the machine is started, the values that were saved by ` M500 will once again be applied. If you want to cancel the changes saved by M500 permanently, you can run M502 and then  ` M500.
