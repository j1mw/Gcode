### Parameters

* `P"nnn"` Password

## Examples

* ` M551  ` P"my-very-secret-word"

The code 'P' is not part of the password. Note that as this is sent in clear it does not (nor is it intended to) offer a security. But on machines that are (say) on a network, it might prevent idle messing about. The password can contain any printable characters except ';', which still means start comment.

if the specified password differs from the default one (i.e. reprap), the user will be asked to enter it when a connection is established.

Quotation marks around the password are mandatory in RRF_3, but discretionary in earlier firmware versions.
