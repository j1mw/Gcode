Sets the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address] of the printer. This should be done before any other network commands. The MAC address is six one-byte hexadecimal numbers separated by colons. The 0x prefix is optional.

All devices running on the same network shall all have different MAC addresses. For your printers, changing the last digit is sufficient.

Note on the Duet 2 Wifi the MAC address is unique and set on the Wifi Module so this command has no effect. The default MAC address on a Duet 2 Ethernet is generated from the unique processor ID so there is normally no need to change it.
