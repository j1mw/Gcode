### Parameters

* `Snnn` minimum target temperature, waits until within 2.5C of target if heating
* `Rnnn` accurate target temperature, waits until within 2.5C of target always
* `Tn` optional tool number

## Examples

* ` M109  ` S215

Deprecated in RRF, but widely generated by slicers. To get the same behaviour, use ` G10 followed by  ` M116

To better support slicers that don't select a tool when doing a single-extrusion print, RRF will always select a tool when processing ` M109. If the T parameter is present, that tool will be selected. If no T parameter is present and no tool is already selected, the tool with the lowest non-negative tool number will be selected (typically tool  ` 0).
