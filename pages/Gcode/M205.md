* `Unnn, Vnnn, Wnnn etc.` U, V, W axis  max instantaneous speed change in mm/sec

## Order Dependency

If this command refers to any axes other than X, Y and Z then it must be later in config.g than the M584 command that creates those additional axes.

This command is provided as an alternative to M566 for compatibility with Marlin. In M566 the units are mm/min as with all other speeds. In M205 they are in mm/sec.
