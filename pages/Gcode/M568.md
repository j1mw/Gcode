{{site.data.alerts.note}}
Deprecated: from firmware 1.19 onwards, this command is no longer required or supported. If a G1 command for the tool provides just one E value, then the mix ratio defined by M567 will always be used.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Usage ##

| `M568 Pnnn Snnn` |

### Parameters ###

+ `Pnnn` Tool number
+ `Snnn` Whether mix ratios should be activated

## Example ##

+ `M568 P2 S0`

Turn on/off automatic mix ratios for tool 2. If the S parameter is 0 mixing is turned off; if it is non-zero it is turned on.

After turning off command G1 instructions must send as many E values as the tool has drives:

G1 X20 E0.2:0.4:0.166:0.3

The off state is the default.
