## Usage ##
```
M150 Rnnn Unnn Bnn Ynn Snnn Fn
```

## Parameters ##

+ Rnnn red (0-255)
+ Unnn green (0-255)
+ Bnnn blue (0-255)
+ Ynn brightness (0-31)
+ Snnn number of LEDs in strip to set, default 30
+ Fn F1 if further commands for later LEDs in the strip follow; F0 (default) if this command programs the entire strip, or this is the last of several commands to program the strip (causes the next M150 command to start from the beginning of the strip again)

## Example ##

+ M150 R255 U128 B192 Y16 S100 F0 ; set 100 LEDs to the same colour

This is only supported on controllers that have an output connector for DotStar LEDs.

Range for RGB values is 0-255. The specified RGB values will be sent to the number of LEDs in the LED strip as specified by the S parameter, pushing the existing colours along the strip. To set all the LEDs the same colour, make the S parameter equal to or a little longer than the number of LEDs in the strip.
