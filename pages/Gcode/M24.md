## Examples

* M24

The machine prints from the file selected with the ` M23 command. If the print was previously paused with M25, printing is resumed from that point. To restart a file from the beginning, use M23 to reset it, then  ` M24.

When this command is used to resume a print that was paused, the macro file `resume.g` is run prior to resuming the print.
