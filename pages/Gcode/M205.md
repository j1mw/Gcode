## Order Dependency

If this command refers to any axes other than X, Y and Z then it must be later in config.g than the ` M584 command that creates those additional  ` axes.

This command is provided as an alternative to ` M566 for compatibility with Marlin. In M566 the units are mm/min as with all other speeds. In M205 they are in mm/ ` sec.
