## ` M558 in RepRapFirmware 2.x and earlier  ` 

### Parameters

* `Pnnn` Z probe type
* `Fnnn` Feed rate (i.e. probing speed, mm/min)
* `Hnnn` Dive height (mm). When using mesh bed compensation or running ` G30 commands with specified XY coordinates (for example from the bed.g file), the firmware moves the Z probe to this height above where it expects the bed to be before commencing probing. The maximum depth of probing from this position is twice the dive height. A large dive height will tolerate a very uneven bed or poor calibration. A small dive height will make probing faster, because the Z probe has less distance to travel before reaching the bed. Default value if omitted is  ` 5mm.
* `Innn` Invert (I1) or do not invert (I0, default) the Z probe reading (RepRapFirmware 1.16 and later)
* `Rnnn` Z probe recovery time before the probing move is started , default zero (seconds) (RepRapFirmware 1.17 and later). This is to allow the probe to settle after executing a travel move to the coordinates to probe.
* `Tnnn` Travel speed to and between probe points (mm/min)
* `Annn` Maximum number of times to probe each point, default 1. Maximum, as of 2.03, is 31. Setting ` M558 A parameter to anything >31 set it to 0 instead of to  ` 31
* `Snnn` Tolerance when probing multiple times, default 0.03mm
* `Bn` If 1, turn off all heaters while probing, default (B0) leaves heaters on.  (RepRapFirmware 1.21 and later) 
* `Cn` Endstop input number when the probe type is P4, default 3 (RepRapFirmware 2.02/1.23 and later)

`Obsolete parameters`

* `Xnnn` If nonzero, use probe for homing X axis (RRF 1.19 and earlier)
* `Ynnn` If nonzero, use probe for homing Y axis (RRF 1.19 and earlier)
* `Znnn` If nonzero, use probe for homing Z axis (RRF 1.19 and earlier)

## Examples

* ` M558 P1 X0 Y0 Z1 F500 T5000  ` H3

The H parameter defines the Z probe dive height, which is the height above the trigger height from which probing starts. The default is 3mm or 5mm depending on firmware version. You may wish to increase it during initial calibration.

A Z probe may be a switch, an IR proximity sensor, or some other device. This selects which to use:

* P0 indicates that no Z probe is present. Whenever Z probing is commanded, you will be prompted to jog the Z axis until the nozzle is just touching the bed and then signal completion.
* P1 specifies an unmodulated or smart IR probe, or any other probe type that emulates one (probe output is an analog signal that rises with decreasing nozzle height above the bed).  If there is a control signal to the probe, it is driven high when the probe type is P1.
* P2 specifies a simple modulated IR probe, where the modulation is commanded directly by the main board firmware using the control signal to the probe. 
* P3 is similar to P1 but drives the control signal to the probe low. This may be used to switch between different Z probes.
* P4 selects a switch for bed probing. In recent firmware versions the C parameter specifies the endstop input number, default 3 (on the Duets this is the E0 endstop input).
* P5 (from RepRapFirmware 1.14) selects a switch by default (normally closed) for bed probing between the In and Gnd pins of the Z-probe connector (Duet 0.8.5 and Duet 2 WiFi).
* P6 is as P4 but the switch is connected to an alternative connector (on the Duet series, the E1 endstop connector). Deprecated in recent firmware versions, use P4 C4 instead.
* P7 (from RepRapFirmware 1.20) selects a switch (by default normally closed) connected to the Z endstop input. Deprecated in recent firmware versions, use P4 C2 instead.
* P8 (from RepRapFirmware 1.20) is as P5 but is unfiltered, for faster response time.
* P9 (from RepRapFirmware 1.21RC2) is as P5 but for a BLTouch probe that needs to be retracted and redeployed between probe points.
* P10 means use Z motor stall detection as the Z probe trigger.

In RepRapFirmware versions 1.20beta4 and earlier, the X, Y and Z parameters specify whether each axis uses the Z probe as a substitute homing switch or not. If the parameter is nonzero, the Z probe is used for homing that axis. If the parameter is zero, the endstop switch for that axis is used for homing instead. In firmware 1.20beta6 and later, use the S parameter in the ` M574 command instead to indicate whether you are using a homing switch or a Z probe for homing X and  ` Y.

The A and S parameters control multiple probing. Probing is repeated until two consecutive probe attempts produce results that differ by no more than the S parameter; then the average of those two results is used. However, if the number of attempts specified by the A parameter is reached without getting two consecutive results within tolerance of each other, no further probe attempts are made and the average result of all the attempts is used.

## ` M558 in RepRapFirmware 3  ` 

All of the above for RepRapFirmware 2.x relates to RepRapFirmware 3, except the following:

* New optional parameter K selects the Z probe number. If there is no K parameter then the current Z probe number is used. The current Z probe number is 0 at startup. You can ignore this parameter if you have only one Z probe.
* New parameter C specifies the input pin and the optional modulation pin. This parameter is mandatory, except for probe type 0 (manual probing) and 10 (Z motor stall detection). 
* Invert the input by prefixing the input pin (C parameter) with ! character, when using an NPN output inductive or capacitive sensor or using an NO switch (not recommended, use a NC switch instead). 
* The pullup resistor on the Z probe input is disabled by default. Enable it by prefixing the input pin (C parameter) with the ^ character. Enable pullup resistor with ^ if using Duet 2, running RRF3, using the Z probe input pin, and the probe type is a switch or BLTouch.
* Z probe types 4, 6 and 7 are no longer supported. Instead, use type 5 (filtered digital) or 8 (unfiltered digital) and use the C parameter to specify the input. Note, if your Z probe is connected to the Z endstop input, `in RRF 3.0 on Duet 2 boards only `(not in RRF 3.01 and later, and not in RRF 3.0 on Duet 3), that input is by default pre-assigned to be used by the Z endstop, so you must free it up first.
* Only one Type 2 probe can be configured, and if using Duet 3 + expansion or tool boards, it must be connected to the Duet 3 main board.

Restrictions on defining more than one Z probe (K parameter) as at RRF 3.01:

* ` G29 and G30 commands always used probe 0 and there is no facility to select a different  ` probe
* Only one Z probe can be type 1,2,3,5 or 9. But you can have multiple type 8 Z probes.
* All Z probes use the same deployprobe.g and retractprobe.g files
