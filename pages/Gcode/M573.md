## Usage ##
```
M573 Pnnn
```

## Parameters ##

+ Pnnn Heater number

## Example ##

+ M573 P1

This gives a running average (usually taken over about five seconds) of the PWM to the heater specified by the P field. If you know the voltage of the supply and the resistance of the heater this allows you to work out the power going to the heater. Scale: 0 to 1.
