## Usage ##
```
G53
```

Supported on the Duet 2 and later Duets only.

This causes all coordinates in movement commands on the remainder of the current line of GCode to be interpreted as absolute coordinates, ignoring any coordinate offset of the workplace coordinate system currently in use, and also ignoring any tool offsets. See the NIST GCode Interpreter Version 3 standard for more details.
