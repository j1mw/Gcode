The [https://www.rolanddga.com/support/products/milling/modela-mdx-20-3d-milling-machine.htm|Modela MDX-20] and similar milling machines are very widely available in hackerspaces and maker groups, but annoyingly they don't speak G Codes. As all RepRap firmware includes a G-Code interpreter, it is often easy to add functions to convert G Codes to RML. ` M580 selects a Roland device for output if the R field is 1, and returns to native mode if the R field is 0. The optional P string is sent to the Roland if R is 1. It is permissible to call this repeatedly with R set to 1 and different strings in the P field to communicate directly with a  ` Roland.
