## Usage ##
```
M703
```

## Parameters ##

+ This command can be used without any additional parameters.

## Example ##

+ M703

After assigning a filament to a tool, this command may be used to run /filaments/<filament name>/config.g to set parameters like temperatures, extrusion factor, retract distance. If no filament is loaded, the code completes without a warning.

If the filaments feature is used, it is recommended to put this code into tpost*.g to ensure the right filament parameters are set. Supported in RepRapFirmware 2.02 and newer.
