### Parameters

* `Pnnn` Logical pin number used to control the laser (not supported in RRF_3, see notes)
* `I`n Invert (I1) or don't invert (I0, default) the output polarity (not supported in RRF_3, see notes)
* `Rnnn` The value of the S parameter in M3 commands that corresponds to full laser power, default 255
* `Sn` 1= laser power is sticky across G1 commands, 0 (default) = laser is off when executing G1 commands that have no S parameter
* `Fnnn` The PWM frequency used to drive the laser

## Examples

* M452 P2 R255 F200 ; switch to laser mode using the heater 2 (E1 heater) output pins to control the laser

Switches to laser mode. This mode enables handling of a laser pin and makes sure that the laser is only activated during G1 moves if laser was enabled or E is increasing. G0 moves should never enable the laser. M3/M5 can be used to enable/disable the laser for moves. Logical pin numbers for the P parameter are as defined for the M42 and M208 commands. If a heater or fan output is used to control the laser, you must disable the corresponding heater (see M307) or fan (see M106) first.

`Very important!` If you use M452 to put your machine into Laser mode and are running Firmware `2.02 or above`, you must replace all S parameters in G0/G1 commands in homing files etc. by H parameters. This is because S is now used to control laser power.

`Notes - RepRapFirmware 3`

In RRF_3, the P and I parameters are removed. Use the C parameter to select the laser control pin instead.

Example - old code (RRF_2.x):

```
M452 P3 I1 F100  ; laser uses heater3 pin, PWM frequency 100Hz
```

New code (RRF_3):

```
M452 C"exp.heater3" Q100 ; laser uses heater3 pin,  PWM frequency 100Hz
```
