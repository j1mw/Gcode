### Parameters

* `Pnnn` Gateway

## Examples

* ` M554  ` P192.168.1.1

Sets the Gateway IP address of the RepRap machine to (in this case) 192.168.1.1. A restart may be required before the new gateway IP address is used. If no 'P' field is specified, this echoes the existing Gateway IP address configured.

DuetWifiFirmware versions 1.18 and earlier do not support setting the gateway address.
