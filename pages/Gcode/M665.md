### Parameters

* `Lnnn` Diagonal rod length<sub>2</sub>
* `Rnnn` Delta radius
* `Bnnn` Safe printing radius
* `Hnnn` Nozzle height above the bed when homed after allowing for endstop corrections
* `Xnnn` X tower position correction<sub>1</sub>
* `Ynnn` Y tower position correction<sub>1</sub>
* `Znnn` Z tower position correction<sub>1</sub>

## Examples

* ` M665 L250 R160 B80 H240 X0 Y0  ` Z0

Set the delta calibration variables

## Notes

<sub>1</sub>X, Y and Z tower angular offsets from the ideal (i.e. equilateral triangle) positions, in degrees, measured anti-clockwise looking down on the printer.

<sub>2</sub>In RRF 2.03 and later, multiple L values can be provided, for example `L260.1:260.2:260.0`. The values are the lengths of the rods to the X, Y and Z towers respectively. If more than 3 values are provided, the firmware assumes that there are as many towers as L values up to the maximum supported (currently 6). The XY coordinates of the additional towers must be defined subsequently using the ` M669 command. If only one L value is provided, the machine is assumed to have 3 towers with all rods having the same  ` length.
