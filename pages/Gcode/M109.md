## Usage ##

| `M109 Snnn Rnnn Tn` | 


### Parameters ###

+ `Snnn` minimum target temperature, waits until within 2.5C of target if heating
+ `Rnnn` accurate target temperature, waits until within 2.5C of target always
+ `Tn` optional tool number

## Example ##

+ `M109 S215`

Deprecated in RRF, but widely generated by slicers. To get the same behaviour, use G10 followed by M116

To better support slicers that don't select a tool when doing a single-extrusion print, RRF will always select a tool when processing M109. If the T parameter is present, that tool will be selected. If no T parameter is present and no tool is already selected, the tool with the lowest non-negative tool number will be selected (typically tool 0).
