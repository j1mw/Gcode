### Parameters

* `Xnnn` Scale factor for X axis
* `Ynnn` Scale factor for Y axis
* `Znnn` Scale factor for Z axis
* `U, V, W, A, B, C` Scale factors for additional axes

## Examples

* ` M579 X1.0127  ` Y0.998

On a Cartesian RepRap you can get prints exactly the right size by tweaking the axis steps/mm using the ` M92 G Code above. But this does not work so easily for Delta and other RepRaps for which there is cross-talk between the axes. This command allows you to adjust the X, Y, and Z axis scales directly. So, if you print a part for which the Y length should be 100mm and measure it and find that it is 100.3mm long then you set Y0.997 (= 100/ ` 100.3).

On a suitable-configured IDEX printer, a scaling factor of -1 for the U axis can be used to turn a ditto print into a mirror image print.
