### Parameters

* None

## Examples

* M501

Set the active parameters to those stored in sys/config-override.g on the SD card. This command should be included near the end of the config.g file so that the stored parameters will be loaded at startup. It can also be used to revert parameters to the values stored in config-override.g after experimenting with them.
