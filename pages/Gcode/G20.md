## Examples

* G20

Units from this command onwards are in inches. Note that this is only intended to affect ` G0, G1 and other commands commonly found in GCode files that represent objects to print. Specifically G20 only affects: G0 to G3, G10 and  ` G92.

So you should use metric values in config.g when configuring the printer and then change to inches with ` G20 at the end of it if the Gcodes you want to send to move the machine are expressed in  ` inches.
