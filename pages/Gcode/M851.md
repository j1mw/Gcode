## Usage ##

| `M851 Znn` | 

### Parameters ###
+ `Znn ???`

RepRapFirmware 2.02 and later

M851 Znn is implemented for backwards compatibility with other firmware. It sets the Z probe trigger in the same way as G31 Z-nn (note the sign reversal). It also flags the Z-probe G31 parameters as to be saved in config-override.g if the M500 command is used.

G31 should be used in preference to M581.
